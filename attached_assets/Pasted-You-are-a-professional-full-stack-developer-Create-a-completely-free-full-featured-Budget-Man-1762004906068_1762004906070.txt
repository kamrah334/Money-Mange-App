You are a professional full-stack developer.

Create a **completely free, full-featured Budget Manager web app** that works offline and includes Google Drive backup and restore.

⚙️ Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS
- Charts: Recharts
- Offline Database: IndexedDB (via Dexie.js or idb)
- Backup/Restore: Google Drive API (OAuth 2.0)
- Deployment: Vercel
- NO paid APIs, NO OpenAI

💡 Features Overview:
- App Name: Smart Budget Manager (Free Edition)
- Fully Offline PWA (installable on desktop/mobile)
- Save transactions (Cash In / Cash Out)
- Show Total In, Total Out, and Balance
- History view with filters (by date, category, or amount)
- Analytics: pie & bar charts by category and month
- Backup & Restore data using Google Drive (JSON file)
- CSV export (for manual download)
- Light/Dark mode toggle
- Mobile-friendly responsive UI

🧠 Smart Categorization (Free AI Logic)
- Use **local keyword-based categorization** (no external APIs)
- Example:
    - if text includes ["salary", "bonus", "income"] → Category = Income
    - if text includes ["food", "meal", "restaurant"] → Category = Food
    - if text includes ["rent", "bills", "electricity"] → Category = Utilities
    - if text includes ["shopping", "clothes", "store"] → Category = Shopping
    - else → Category = Others
- Works fully offline in browser with no internet needed

📁 Data Management:
- IndexedDB stores transactions locally
- Backup JSON to Google Drive
- Restore JSON from Google Drive
- Optional “Export to CSV” button for manual download
- Daily auto-backup (when online)
- Users can choose manual backup anytime

🎨 UI/UX:
- Dashboard Page → Total Cash In, Total Cash Out, Balance
- Add Transaction Page → form for amount, type (in/out), description
- History Page → scrollable list with edit/delete buttons
- Analytics Page → charts & summaries
- Settings Page → dark/light mode, Google Drive sync, export options

🔒 Security & Privacy:
- OAuth 2.0 for Google Drive (user’s data stays private)
- Sanitize user input (no injection or XSS)
- No server-side database (local only)
- No paid APIs or hidden network calls

📦 Deployment:
- Generate full Next.js + Tailwind app ready for GitHub + Vercel
- Include `README.md` with:
  - Local setup instructions
  - How to deploy on Vercel
  - How to set up Google OAuth 2.0 credentials
  - How backup & restore work
  - How to use the app offline

🎯 Goal:
Generate a full production-ready codebase that:
1. Works offline as a PWA
2. Stores data locally
3. Backs up to Google Drive
4. Categorizes automatically using free logic
5. Looks modern and professional
6. Deploys on Vercel with zero cost
